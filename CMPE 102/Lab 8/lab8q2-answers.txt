How will the new assembly instructions look like for the above 2 lines?

--> movl  0x8(%ebp), -0x8(%ebp)   // c = a
--> movl  0xC(%ebp), -0x4(%ebp)   // d = b

What are the offsets of parameters a and b?

--> a = +0x8(%ebp)
--> b = +0xC(%ebp)

What causes the sign of the offset to be positive or negative?

--> parameters are at positive offsets while locals are at negative offsets
