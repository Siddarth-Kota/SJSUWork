First change we made was adding different sounds to the makesound function in order to have different sounds for the child classes
we added all the required components of the Parent Animal class
we added the attributes for the Dog and Cat class and created constructors for both of the child classes
we then added all the functions for the main function to test.
we had some difficulties compiling the file without using g++ for both the main file and the Animal.cpp file
we fixed this issue by including the Animal.cpp in the main class so it is compiled alongside the rest of the files
For the Additional extensions we added an output operator that prints all the relevant information specific to that class
We then added a playGame function that prints a specific game based on which animal is doing the action
Then we overloaded the makeSound function by adding an argument for number of times it should print the sound
Next we added a protected section that includes a print function for output that the overloaded operator uses.
Lastly we added a eatFood function with overrides in the dog and cat classes.
Overall we learned a lot about function heirarchy and how virtual functions work
