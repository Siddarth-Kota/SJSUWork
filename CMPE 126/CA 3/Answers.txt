1. For which problem did you do the base case and for which ones did you do the recursive formulation?

 - I did the base case for the Fibbonaci sequence and the recursive algorithm for the decimal to Binary function.

2. Which of these seems easier to figure out?

 - The Fibbonaci sequence was easier to figure out because it has a clear base case and the recursive relationship is straightforward. 
   The decimal to binary conversion was a bit more complex as it required understanding how to break down the number into smaller parts.

3. Did you try to code any of these problems? If so, was it easier to do the code after solving the problem on pen-and-paper?

 - Yes, I tried to code both problems. For the Fibbonaci sequence it wasn't too difficult to code directly, 
   but for the decimal to binary problem, solving the recursive formulation on pen-and-paper first made it much 
   easier to implement the code.

4. If you figured out a trick based on your discussions, please mention it here.

 - A useful trick I found was the formula for the decimal to binary conversion: return n % 2 + 10 * decimalToBinary(n / 2);
   This was helpful because it shows how it builds the decimal using the mod function to build the binary number from the least 
   significant bit to the most significant bit.
